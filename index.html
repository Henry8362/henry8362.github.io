          <h1> The problem of amenable deaths </h1>
          <p> 597,000 deaths occured in the UK in 2016,
            75,736 of these were deemed amenable by the UK Office of National Statistics.
          </p>
          <p class="regular"> A large proportion of these deaths occur in hospitals. </p>
          <h1> Did you know? </h1>
          <p> 35%-64% of all hospital deaths or adverse events such as spsis or acute kidney
            injury were not recognised early enough and these patients received sub-optimal care.
          </p>
          <p> The severity in a patient's illness is missed because the traditional methods
            of identification are no longer able to cope with the speed, volume or complexity
            of data a patient generates, nor are they able to identify the subtle patterns of disease
            and deterioration.
          </p>
          <p class="regular"> Early identification and optimal treatment could prevent up to half these adverse events.</p>

         <h1> Meet Life Engine </h1>
         <p>Life Engine is an Artificial Intelligence who helps save patientâ€™s lives.</p>
         <p>She has learnt from millions of anonymised patient journeys, over 1 billion blood results and understands whether a patient
            is getting better or worse more accurately than any existing system or algorithm.</p>
         <p>She integrates with the hospital to identify critically ill patients earlier, tracks their progress and automates repetitive tasks.</p>
         <p>Continuously learning from guidelines and the effectiveness of interventions, she also advises on patient management to both optimise care and reduce variation.</p>
